Here's a Python program to generate the Fibonacci series using an efficient iterative approach: ```python def fibonacci(n): # Handle invalid cases if n <= 0: return [] # First two terms if n == 1: return [0] # Initialize list with first two terms fib_series = [0, 1] # Generate subsequent terms for _ in range(2, n): next_term = fib_series[-1] + fib_series[-2] fib_series.append(next_term) return fib_series # Get user input try: n = int(input("Enter number of Fibonacci terms: ")) # Generate and display series result = fibonacci(n) print(f"Fibonacci series with {n} terms:") print(result) except ValueError: print("Please enter a valid positive integer.") ``` ### Explanation: 1. **Function Definition**: The `fibonacci(n)` function: - Returns an empty list for `n <= 0` - Returns `[0]` for `n = 1` - Generates a series starting with `[0, 1]` for `n >= 2` - Uses efficient iteration to generate subsequent terms by summing the last two terms in the sequence 2. **User Interaction**: - Reads an integer input from the user - Handles non-integer inputs with error checking - Prints the generated Fibonacci series ### Example Outputs: For input `5`: ``` Fibonacci series with 5 terms: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3] ``` For input `1`: ``` Fibonacci series with 1 terms: [0] ``` For input `10`: ``` Fibonacci series with 10 terms: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34] ``` The program is efficient (O(n) time complexity) and handles invalid inputs gracefully. The first term of the series is 0, following modern computer science conventions for Fibonacci sequences.
